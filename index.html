<p>10. Metallica set a Guinness World Record for becoming the first musical act to perform on every continent. The band headed to Antartica in 2013 to perform at Carlini Base. Metallica and Coca-Cola organized a competition for fans to win tickets, where the fans also received a weeklong Antartica cruise.</p>

<p>16. My favorite song by Metallica, “Whiskey In The Jar”, was not originally written by them. The song was an original Irish folk song and it was first recorded in 1951 by Seamus Ennis (from Ireland).The 2nd most popular version of the song was recorded by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy in 1972.</p>

<p>17. Metallica met with tragic misfortune in 1986 when their bassist, Cliff Burton, died in a tour bus accident. Burton was thrown out of the bus’s window when the vehicle began to careen from side to side. The bus then landed on Burton, and an attempt to save him with a crane only led to the bus crashing onto him again. The bus driver said he hit a patch of black ice, but frontman James Hetfield said he walked up and down the street afterward and didn’t encounter any. Hetfield speculates the driver might have been drunk or asleep at the wheel, but a subsequent investigation cleared the driver of any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>18. The band’s second album Ride the Lightning is known for its blue cover. However, a French press misprint led to about 400 green copies, which have now become collector’s items.</p>
